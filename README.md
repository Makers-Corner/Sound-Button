## A battery powered meme sound button built with an ESP32 and I2S audio amplifier.

## Press the button. Play the chaos. Repeat.

## This project is designed to be simple, portable, and perfect for bars, parties, live streams, office chaos, or annoying your friends on demand.

## *IMPORTANT!!! TEST EVERYTHING BEFORE FINAL ASSEMBLY!!!*

## *Make sure the audio you upload is what you REALLY want. Once the battery is connected and the device is fully closed up it will be impossible to change. Is this something that can be fixed? Possibly.. Are my arduino skills good enough to do it? Not yet.. If I am able to figure it out in the future I will update accordingly. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!*
